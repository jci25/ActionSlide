===========

This is just an example app that is pulling comics from the cyanide and happiness website.


The goal was to use some "newer" libraries in the market to get a sleeker "4.0" style ui.


I used  jfeinstein10's sliding menu library: https://github.com/jfeinstein10/SlidingMenu

        JakeWharton's ActionBarSherlock: https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock
        
        nadavafima's Cards ui lib: https://bitbucket.org/nadavfima/cardsui-for-android
        
        thest1's lazylist: https://github.com/thest1/LazyList
        
        
It was a good introduction to using third party libraries but not executed perfectly.


This app was for my personal usage so I did not publish it to the play store.
